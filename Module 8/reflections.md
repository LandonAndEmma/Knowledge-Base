# Module 08 — Reflections

## What I learned
- GitHub is a development platform, not just a remote Git host — it supports collaboration (issues, PRs), docs (README/wikis), and publishing (Pages).
- Fork + Pull Request is the canonical Open Source contribution flow.
- README and a clean project landing page are essential for discoverability; GitHub Pages is a quick way to publish docs or portfolio sites.
- GitHub’s social features (stars, follows, contribution graph) help discoverability and showcase activity.

## How I applied it (actions I will / did take)
- Created or updated `README.md` in the repo summarizing the project and how to use it.
- Considered adding a Wiki for longer notes and tutorials.
- Experimented with GitHub Pages (or planned to enable it if a docs site is useful).
- Practiced a fork → branch → commit → push → PR cycle on a sample repo (or plan to do so).

## Example items to include in README (quick checklist)
- Project purpose
- Quick install / run instructions
- How to contribute (fork → branch → PR)
- Links to project Wiki or Pages (if available)
- License and contact info

## Questions for instructor
- None

## Personal takeaways
- Good repository presentation matters — a clear README + project structure increases project adoption and makes contributions easier.
- I’ll maintain a short contributing guide and use PRs for collaboration going forward.
